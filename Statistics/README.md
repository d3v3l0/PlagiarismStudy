Gathering statistics is the final and the main stage of Plagiarism Detection. 

Firstly, GatherData.py collects all the necessary information about the blocks into the created /data/ subdirectory. In the process, it creates a temporary file resultsExtended.pairs, which consists of only the pairs of interest. It then uses a set of the blocks of interest from these pairs to collect the information:
* The licenses are collected using the latest version of [ninka](http://ninka.turingmachine.org/) (the repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/dmgerman/ninka)), which parses the top of each file and lists the possible licenses. If ninka detects a license, we choose the most probable one, if it doesn't â€” we choose the project's license from PGA data, and if the project also doesn't have a license, we list it as "All Rights Reserved". The results are stored in StatisticsLicensesFiles.txt. *Please note that you should download Ninka yourself and insert the necessary path to ninka.pl into the file and also StatisticsLicensesFiles.txt requires manual relabeling and checking.*
* *git blame* is used to gather the information about the last time of modifications of the blocks. The information is collected for all the necessary files (stored in StatisticsBlameFiles.txt), then for each block the largest mode among its lines is calculated and the resulting date is considered to be this block's last time of modification. This data is stored in StatisticsBlameBlocks.txt.

Additionally, if any of the file names has a character that doesn't allow it to be processed by either ninka or git blame, it is listed in StatisticsBadFiles.txt, and in the end, the final list of pairs resultsRelated.pairs is compiled for the next step.

Next, GetNeighbors.py compiles a list of all blocks of interest and a list of all their clones for each of them. In the process, it creates a subdirectory /data/neighbors/ for temporary.

After that, various statistics are gathered with separate scripts, here is a short summary:

* GetLicensingStatistics.py compiles the distribution of licenses in the corpus, divides the files by the amount of licenses and saves various cases of multi-licensing.
* GetLicensingStatisticsBlocks.py does the same, but for blocks.
* GetPlagiarism.py compiles the information about the license pairs that constitute possible violations. 
* GetCumulativePlagiarism.py counts the percentages of each license pair in the corpus. *Please note that this list needs to manually labeled as permissive or prohibiting license pairs.*
* GetViolated.py compiles the information about the most violated and the most violating licenses.
* GetPlagiarismBlocks.py counts the older clones of each blocks and those of them that come from a restrictive licenses.
* GetAnalysis.py divides these blocks into Types of violations.
* GetAnalysisWeak.py divides the Weak Violation blocks into percentiles.

The results of running these scripts for our datasets are presented in **Results**.
